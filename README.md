# TargetedMarketing
TargetedMarketing- Customer Segmentation model for Campaigns

#Objective:
The objective of ‘Targeted Marketing’ is to develop a segmentation model for “GetAllMart” that leverages
customer behavior and purchasing patterns to identify opportunities for higher campaign profits and targeted
marketing efforts. By meeting the unique needs of specific customer segments, we aim to increase customer
satisfaction and loyalty while maximizing campaign profits, ultimately improving the overall effectiveness of
the company’s marketing strategy.

#Findings from Clustering:
Based on the demographics, spend patterns, and responses to the current campaign strategy we have identified
four distinct customer segments (Clusters) (refer Table 1).
1. The first segment consists of loyal customers with household size ~ 2. However, they do not respond
well to campaigns nor store wide deals despite being active on all purchase platforms. These customers
have been with us for about a year and are in the high income category.
2. The second segment consists of medium income customers with household size ~3. These customers
have been with our company the longest and respond highly to deals. However when it comes to
personalized campaigns, they have a moderate response as evidenced by the average revenue earned
from each customer.
3. The third segment consists of low-income customers who are relatively new to “GetAllMart” and have
household size ~3. Their campaign and non-campaign spend patterns are lowest among all groups
indicating the lack of purchasing power. They do not respond well to store wide deals nor Campaigns.
In fact the company is losing money by targeting this segment.
4. The fourth segment consists of high-income customers who are about a year old with “GetAllMart”,
has a household size ~2 and slightly leaning towards single person household. These customers are
engaged the most with “GetAllMart” across product categories and are most profitable. They respond
well to the personalized campaigns however they don’t seem to engage with us on store wide deals.

#Recommendations for each Cluster:
1. For the first cluster, it is evident that the current marketing campaigns focused on Wine & Meat
are not working. We recommend testing a completely different offer focused on daily groceries and
assessing its performance to see if the response rate goes up.
2. For the second cluster, we suggest conducting A/B testing between the current offer focused on Wine
& Meat and the new offer focused on fruit, fish, and sweets. Since this group belongs to medium
income category and household size ~3 there is potential that they would respond well to offer focused
on daily groceries. This will help evaluate if there is an other promotion mix that will make them even
more profitable.
3. For the third customer cluster, we recommend not targeting them for future campaigns as our analysis
shows that the cost of targeting this cluster is $3 while the profits are negative. However, if we do
decide to target this cluster in future, we suggest sending offers on daily household groceries instead
of pricier items such as wines as a household with kids/teens and lower income tends to look for offers
in food category.
4. For the fourth cluster, we believe our current marketing strategy is highly profitable and recommend
keeping the same strategy for this cluster.
